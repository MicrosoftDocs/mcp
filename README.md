## üéØ Overview

### ‚ú® What is the Microsoft Docs MCP Server?

The Microsoft Docs MCP Server is a cloud-hosted service that enables MCP hosts like GitHub Copilot and Cursor to search and retrieve accurate information directly from Microsoft's official documentation. By implementing the standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP), this service allows any compatible AI system to ground its responses in authoritative Microsoft content.

### üìä Key Capabilities

- **High-Quality Content Retrieval**: Search and retrieve relevant content from Microsoft Learn, Azure documentation, Microsoft 365 documentation, and other official Microsoft sources.
- **Semantic Understanding**: Uses advanced vector search to find the most contextually relevant documentation for any query.
- **Optimized Chunking**: Returns up to 10 high-quality content chunks (each max 500 tokens), with article titles, URLs, and self-contained content excerpts.
- **Real-time Updates**: Access the latest Microsoft documentation as it's published.

## üõ†Ô∏è Currently Supported Tools

| Tool Name | Description | Input Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| `microsoft_docs_search` | Performs semantic search against Microsoft official technical documentations | `query` (string): The search query for retrieval |

7. A file named `mcp.json` will be created in the `.vscode` folder:
```
{
  "servers": {
    "microsoft.docs.mcp": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

8. If successful, you should be connected to the MCP server and see 1 tool available.

### üìù Getting Started

1. Open VS Code and [switch to Agent mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode).

2. Verify that the Microsoft Docs MCP Server (`microsoft.docs.mcp`) appears in the list of tools.

3. Test the server by prompting the agent with a query, e.g., "How to create an app service in Azure portal using microsoft docs?"

4. The agent should use the Microsoft Docs MCP Server to retrieve relevant documentation.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Connection errors | Verify your network connection and that the server URL is correctly entered |
| No results returned | Try rephrasing your query with more specific technical terms |
| Tool not appearing in VS Code | Restart VS Code or check that the MCP extension is properly installed |
